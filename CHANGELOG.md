iptables-ng CHANGELOG
=====================

This file is used to list changes made in each version of the iptables-ng cookbook.

4.1.0
-----

- Remove deprecated foodcritic linting
- Apply cookstyle linting fixes
- Enable unified_mode
- Rewrite tests to Inspec, remove deprecated minitest
- Remove logic for EOL distros
- Update kitchen test platforms
- Support Github Actions for integration tests


4.0.0
-----

- Add support for Chef-13

NOTE: If you want to continue using `iptables-ng` on Chef 12, version lock this cookbook to `3.0.1`. This can be achieved by putting the following in your `Berksfile`:

```ruby
cookbook 'iptables-ng', '~> 3.0.1'
```

3.0.1
-----

- Fix issue with resource cloning in Chef 13

3.0.0
-----

Release to workaround cloning issues, for the upcoming Chef-13 release:
- Removed the feature to automatically run `iptables-ng::install` upon LWRP
  usage. It's now required to manually run `iptables-ng::install` before using
  the LWRPs. This can be achieved by adding the following before using the
  LWRPs for the first time (also make sure it's only included once):
```ruby
include_recipe 'iptables-ng::install'
```
- Removed the feature to automatically create new custom chains when using the
  `iptables_ng_rule` provider. Custom chains are now required to be added
  manually before using them:
```ruby
iptables_ng_chain 'CUSTOM'
iptables_ng_rule 'rule-using-custom-chain'
```

This release also fixes a bug previously introduced by trying to workaround the
cloning issues, where a chain policy wasn't properly updated. See [this
issue](https://github.com/chr4-cookbooks/iptables-ng/issues/63) for details.
